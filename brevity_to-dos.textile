* Allow it to toggle on and off
** Should be able to toggle without affecting other mappings

* Create brief tutorial

* Change the command to create a new mapping (it's currently a double semi-colon, which I think will conflict with other plugins)

* Set up so that default punctuation and mappings will be used unless modified versions exist
** Where would these be put? In .vim or in the plugin file?

* Email Michael Geddes to tell him about changes?
